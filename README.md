A basic breakout-like game made with Ruby

## What is this?
This game was made in 2008 as an educational tool for teaching a student how to write a game in Ruby. 

## Why bother making a game with Ruby?
Ruby is very easy to learn and use, and is more than powerful and fast enough to create games with.

## The physics are terrible!
Yeah, I agree. The focus of the tutoring session was not on perfecting the gameplay, just on getting things working.
